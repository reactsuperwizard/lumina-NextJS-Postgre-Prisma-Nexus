# Running Log User Release Notes

## 20210409 Release
* User's logging in for the first time now get a password reset (creation) page that is not confusing
* User's can now be deleted from admin panel
* Todo button for password resets has been removed as it is not needed
* A new Renders view now exist in admin, accessible via the left hand menu. This displays all videos currently in the queue, being rendered, and the most recent 5 completed/errored.
* Adjustments have been made to Script editing to better match text behavior to the way it is displayed in the videos.  Some variance is inevitable due to certain letters being different widths in different fonts.
* Updating video thumbnails is no longer tied to rendering videos.
* Update Thumbnail buttons can be found in the video preview from the Production dashboard and in the Video detail view.  All videos will currently be set to 1.5 seconds in, if this needs to be updated please submit a ticket to let us know.
* Small updates were made to all Templates to be more reliable and consistent, please let us know if you run into any unforeseen behavior.
* Now links like lmna.io/1234 can be shared to social with video preview and redirect when link is clicked
* The portal logo has been updated to use a higher resolution image
* The portal logo is now clickable to return to videos
* Navigating to user profiles now uses their id rather than their email in the url (more secure)
